# Algorithmic-Trading-Model-for-Investment-Decision-Making
The project discusses financial investment and how individuals, institutions,
and governments make investment decisions based on their goals and market
analysis. It mentions that technical charts suggest buying McDonald's stock
in large volume as the signal is "buy," and predicts that the stock price will
rise. The fundamental analysis states that McDonald's stock is performing
average, with better cash flows in the previous year, and has faced
competition and pressure to adapt to changing consumer preferences. The
project also provides the current stock price of McDonald's and predicts a
potential return on investment for buying shares. According to our research,
it is advisable that in the future the price of the stock will increase, so one
should buy the shares at this point of time to earn a good return on
investment.
